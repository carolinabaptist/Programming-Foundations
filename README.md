The Maze  <br />

In this first Fundamentals of Programming project, students will develop
functions that allow you to implement a program to simulate the movement of a
Drive through a 2D maze containing obstacles and other units. This unit
always moves to an adjacent space in order to get closer to one of the
nearest reachable units remaining in the maze.
